# 30 Days of Framer Code

## Introduction

This repository store the code for all of my [30 Days of Framer](https://hermy0211.github.io/framer30/) projects, so you can start building a similar project on your own.

Not all of the functionality was built on code alone, and I am preparing a [Medium](https://medium.com/@annelee_22736) post for every project so you can see how the code and designs fit in together.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at hermy0211@naver.com.
